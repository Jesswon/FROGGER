Frogger by Jessica Won
The goal of this version of Frogger is to safely direct the frogs to all four lilypads. In order to reach 
the lilypads, the frog must go through two obstacles: First, the frog must cross the road without being hit 
by a vehicle and second, the frog must hop onto the logs without falling in the water. If the frog fails to 
pass through these obstacles safely, then the number of frogs will decrease each time; if there are no frogs 
remaining it will be game over.
